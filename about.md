## About the content

The software presented on this site were written by Feherke and are distributed through GitHub. All of them are free software ( both as in free beer and as in free
speech ).

**Most** of them are distributed under the terms of [GNU General Public License](http://gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) version 3 or newer.

**Exceptions** are the old Bash scripts which are still distributed under my old _Use them healthy_ license with the following terms :

* you not have to pay for them
* you not have to request permission to use them
* you not have to advertise me on your site
* you not have to delete them after a period

Violation of the first condition will make me sad. Feel free to contravene the others, but please let me know about.

## About the site

This site was generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), the free static site generator written in [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org/). As advertised, Jekyll is blog-aware,
but not not-all-sites-are-blogs-aware. I mean, due to the lack of support for a regular site's basic necessities, I had to use plugins. Sadly GitHub pages'
documentation regarding the plugin support is almost inexistent, so I will have to discover the possible restrictions on the fly. So malfunctions are possible. Sorry.

The pages' formatting was done by [kramdown](http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/) as I found it more suitable for my needs then [Maruku](http://maruku.rubyforge.org/). That
not means any of them is better. I just got less weird errors with kramdown. But with or without error messages, the processing may still differ to my intentions. Sorry.

(For example I can not convince both Liquid and kramdown to handle everything as UTF-8. Hence my name is written correnctly as Fehérke in this page's content, but not
in the page headers and footers and in the document meta data.)
