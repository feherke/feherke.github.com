* Specify image file format using the extension of iph.png. ( First of all GIF and JPEG, then maybe others too. )
* Specify text data structure using the extension of blah.txt. ( First of all HTML, XML and JSON, then maybe others too. )
* Clarify the img HTML tag-based syntax for the imgplace tag. ( foo=bar, foo="bar", "foo=bar", "foo='bar'" - when is bar string literal and when template variable name. )
* Implement multi-line text for image placeholder. ( Maybe with alignment too : "<left aligned", ">right aligned", "centered". )
* Maybe when the src attribute is specified for imgplace filter and tag, create the placeholder in that given place. ( May not be a good idea. )
* Think about implementing border for image placeholder. ( Either just 1 pixel of front color, or something customizable. )
