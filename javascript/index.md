# JavaScript

JavaScript made its way into my life in all areas. ( Although [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) is still on my TODO list, I already use JavaScript from the command line too. )

Sadly I have no great JavaScript project of my own to share, but some of the minor scripts may be helpful for somebody else too.
