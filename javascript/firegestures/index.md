# FireGestures Scripts

[FireGestures](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firegestures/) is an extension for the [FireFox](http://mozilla.com/firefox/fx/) web browser. It handles
[mouse gestures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_device_gesture) similarly to [those](http://opera.com/browser/tutorials/gestures/) in the
[Opera](http://opera.com/browser/) web browser.

Beside the built-in actions, FireGestures allows editing JavaScript scripts. Such scripts can make use of a tiny [API](http://xuldev.org/firegestures/makescripts.php)
and can reach the chrome. This makes it a powerful but somehow dangerous tool to enhance the browser's capabilities.

Warning !  
As a measure of security do **not** install FireGestures scripts from untrusted sources without proofreading them.
{: .warn}

Warning !  
I am not familiar with the chrome, some of my code may do things it should not.
